See src/docs/database.md for redis/database details and fallback patterns.

Wraps the pure XState machine (literacy-lesson.machine.ts) with persistence and lifecycle management. The machine handles state transitions; this service handles I/O (DB reads/writes, word selection).

## processAnswer(options: ProcessAnswerOptions): Promise\<ProcessAnswerResult>

The main entry point called by the inbound processor at step 7. Handles the full lesson interaction cycle: find-or-create state, run the machine, persist, return result.

1.) Validate options at runtime with `validateProcessAnswerOptions()`. If it fails, let the `BadRequestException` propagate.

2.) If `options.transcripts` is provided and non-empty, extract the `.text` field from each transcript entity and concatenate them into one string with spaces at the joins (`combinedTranscript`). If `options.transcripts` is undefined or empty, set `combinedTranscript = undefined`.

3.) Call `findCurrentState(options.user.id)` to get the current lesson state from the database.

4.) Determine whether to start fresh or continue:
* If `findCurrentState` returned null → start a new lesson (step 5).
* If `created_at` is older than 60 seconds → start a new lesson (step 5).
* If `snapshot.status === 'done'` → start a new lesson (step 5).
* Else → rehydrate and run (step 6).

5.) Start a new lesson:
* Call `selectNextWord(options.user.id)` to pick the word.
* Create a new XState actor from the machine with `input: { word, userMessageId: options.user_message_id }`.
* Start the actor. The machine enters the `word` state and the initial context is set (including `stateTransitionId: \`${word}-word-initial\``).
* If `combinedTranscript` is defined, send the ANSWER event: `{ type: 'ANSWER', studentAnswer: combinedTranscript }`.
* Extract the snapshot.
* Go to step 7.

6.) Rehydrate and run:
* If `combinedTranscript` is undefined, throw BadRequestException — rehydrating an existing lesson requires a student answer.
* Create a new XState actor from the machine, restoring from the stored `state.snapshot` (using XState's `createActor(machine, { snapshot: state.snapshot })`).
* Start the actor.
* Before sending the event, update the actor's context with the new `userMessageId`: assign `context.userMessageId = options.user_message_id` (so that any scoreService calls during this transition use the correct trigger).
* Send the ANSWER event: `{ type: 'ANSWER', studentAnswer: combinedTranscript }`.
* Extract the new snapshot.
* Go to step 7.

7.) Persist the new snapshot:
* Single DB round-trip. The INSERT atomically checks `rolled_back = false` on the referenced media_metadata row:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO literacy_lesson_states (user_id, user_message_id, word, snapshot, created_at)
  SELECT $1, $2, $3, $4, now()
  FROM media_metadata m
  WHERE m.id = $2 AND m.rolled_back = false
  RETURNING *
  ```
  Where `$3` is `snapshot.context.word` (denormalized for easy querying).
  If the media has been rolled back, the SELECT returns nothing and no row is inserted.
* If zero rows were returned, it means the media was rolled back or the DB write failed — log WARN and throw (the processor must not send the outbound message).

8.) Return `{ stateTransitionId: snapshot.context.stateTransitionId, isComplete: snapshot.status === 'done' }`.

## findCurrentState(userId: string): Promise\<LiteracyLessonState | null>

Single DB round-trip. Returns the most recent lesson state for the given user.
`SELECT * FROM literacy_lesson_states WHERE user_id = $1 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1`.
Uses the `(user_id, created_at DESC)` index for efficient lookup.
Returns null if no rows exist.

## selectNextWord(userId: string): Promise\<string>

Private helper. Selects the next word for a new lesson based on the student's score history.
// TODO: integrate with ScoreService to pick the word that most needs practice.
// For now: pick a random word from a hardcoded list of curriculum words.
